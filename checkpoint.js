Input: n pairs of vectors v1 and v2, each of length m
Output: Whether or not each pair of vectors is orthogonal
1.     For each pair of vectors do steps 2-3
2.     Call the dot_product procedure with v1 and v2 as arguments, store the result in variable ps
3.     If ps is zero, print "v1 and v2 are orthogonal", else print "v1 and v2 are not orthogonal"
